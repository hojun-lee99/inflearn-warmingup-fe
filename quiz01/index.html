                        >Cursed with a berserker fury, the violent mutant known
                        as Wolverine has a reputation of both as an outstanding
                        superhero and as a lethal killer. Born as James Howlett
                        to a wealthy Canadian family at the end of the 19th
                        century, he was forced to abandon his family after the
                        tragic manifestation of his bestial abilities of
                        accelerated healing factor, keenly enhanced senses and
                        bone claws in each hand. Adopting the name Logan, he
                        wandered the world, living a long life filled with
                        blood, war and betrayal,[89] having vile Sabretooth as
                        his archenemy,[90] and the Japanese warrior Ogun as his
                        sensei.[91] Unfortunately, by acting as a lone wolf,
                        Logan was an unwitting subject of the Weapon X Program
                        and had his bones coated in indestructible Adamantium,
                        becoming an even more lethal asset.[92] Rescued and
                        assisted by Mac and Heather Hudson, he joined Department
                        H as a Canadian government operative known as the
                        Wolverine.</span

                        ability of absorbing the energy of others through
                        physical contact, temporarily incorporating their
                        abilities, powers, memories and even personality with a
                        touch, a process which wears her victims out.[14] A
                        runaway,[15] Rogue was found and adopted by mutant
                        terrorists Mystique and Destiny.[16][17] She had her
                        abilities traumatically activated when she shared her
                        first kiss with a boy and put him into a coma.[18] As
                        part of Mystique's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants Rogue
                        accidentally learned through Destiny that the
                        super-heroine Ms. Marvel was destined to bring tragedy
                        to their life. Deciding to secretly attack Ms. Marvel,
                        Rogue unexpectedly absorbed her entire persona,
                        permanently keeping not only her flight and
                        super-strength powers but also her psyche.[19][14]
                        Gravely affected by this experience, Rogue had no choice
                        but to seek help with Mystique's enemy, Professor
                        Charles Xavier, founder and leader of the X-Men.
                        Contrary to other members' disapproval, Xavier took
                        Rogue in as part of the team.</span

                        Military experiment turned Steve Rogers into America's
                        first Super-Soldier, Captain America. Throughout the
                        war, Cap and his partner, Bucky fought alongside
                        infantry and with a group of heroes known as the
                        Invaders. In the closing months of World War II, Captain
                        America and Bucky were both presumed dead in an
                        explosion. Decades later, Captain America was found
                        trapped in ice and revived in the modern world. Captain
                        America would then later go on to be one of the most
                        important members of the Avengers as well as a leader of
                        the team. As a symbol of freedom and patriotism, a
                        number of men have taken the mantle of Captain America
                        in Rogers' various absences. Of note are William
